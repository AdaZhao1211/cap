# CAPstone
CAP is a web application based on single-cycle MIPS architecture. It accepts C++ code from the user and compiles it into assembly code. It simulates the instructions in microarchitecture, intermediate, gate and transistor layer using color to highlight datapath and text to indicate the data values.
